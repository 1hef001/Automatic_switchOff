# Local Switch off after idle time of 30 mins is reached.
Make sure the idleTime module is made global and the run.py script is used as a startup program.

You can also use run.exe in your startup folder


EDIT : Edit run.py to set the time to 15 mins or less than screen time to avoid going into sleep.
